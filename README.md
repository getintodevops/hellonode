# Hello Node
This is a very basic Hello World application written with Node.

It includes a `Dockerfile` for building a Docker image with the application, and a `Jenkinsfile` that defines a build pipeline for it.

Docker plugin documentation can be found [here](https://go.cloudbees.com/docs/plugins/docker-workflow/).
