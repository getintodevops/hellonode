# Hello Node
This is a very basic Hello World application written with Node.

It includes a `Dockerfile` for building a Docker image with the application, and a `Jenkinsfile` that defines a build pipeline for it.

Docker plugin documentation can be found [here](https://go.cloudbees.com/docs/plugins/docker-workflow/).

## TODO


Check registry URL in docker commons plugin
https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Docker+Commons+Plugin

Check how to share libraries (to share the pipeline
